## 11. Third-Party Services

The following third-party service is used in the app:

- Firebase SDK: Firebase, a development platform provided by Google, is used for various functionalities including analytics, authentication, and database services. Firebase collects and processes certain data as described in the Google Privacy Policy (https://policies.google.com/privacy) and the Firebase Privacy and Security documentation (https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy).

## 12. Consent

By using this service, you consent to this privacy policy and agree to its terms.

## 13. Data Retention and Deletion

Retention of your personal information and user data is limited to one year from your last login. This retention period allows for the provision of continuous service and maintenance of relevant information for your account.

To delete your account and all associated data:

1. Open the Fluent: Speak & Learn Language app
2. Go to Settings
3. Navigate to Data Control
4. Select "Delete Data"

Upon receiving your deletion request, it will be promptly processed and all your personal information and user data will be removed from the systems. 

Additionally, an automatic deletion process is in place. If your account shows no activity for 14 consecutive days, all your personal information and user data will be automatically deleted through a scheduled task (cron job). This ensures that inactive accounts do not retain user data unnecessarily.

Please note that some information may be retained for legal or regulatory purposes, as required by applicable laws, even after automatic deletion or user-requested deletion.

## 14. Sign in with Apple

Fluent: Speak & Learn Language offers "Sign in with Apple" as an authentication option. This feature provides an additional layer of privacy and security for users. When you choose to use Sign in with Apple:

- Apple acts as an intermediary for authentication, allowing you to sign in to the app without sharing your Apple ID email address.
- You have the option to mask your email address. If you choose this option, Apple creates a unique, random email address that forwards to your real email address. This random email address is shared with the app instead of your actual email address.
- The app receives only the information you agree to share. This may include your name and the email address you've chosen to share (either your actual email or the masked email provided by Apple).
- Your Apple ID password is never shared with the app.

The information received through Sign in with Apple is used solely for the purpose of creating and managing your account within the Fluent: Speak & Learn Language app. This information is treated with the same level of security and privacy as all other user data described in this policy.

If you choose to stop using Sign in with Apple with this app:

1. You can revoke the app's access to your Apple ID at any time through your Apple ID settings.
2. Upon revocation, you will no longer be able to sign in to the app using your Apple ID.
3. You may need to create a new account using a different authentication method to continue using the app.

The app developer respects your choice to use Sign in with Apple and your decisions regarding data sharing. The masked email feature, if you choose to use it, allows you to maintain a higher level of privacy while still enabling necessary communication about your account and the service.
